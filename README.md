# Feed-The-Mouth
Small little quirky project where you can feed a big mouth!

# How to run
Download the project from github. Once you have the project downloaded, all you need to do is open on the "index.html" file!
As long as all the other files are in the same folder and you haven't moved anything, the project will run smoothly.

# If you are using VSCode
You may also open the project via VSCode, which is what I personally do. I use the Live Server extention to open up index.html. This should direct
you to your default browser with the project opened.
